The subject of this work is "Experimental platform for research on stereoscopic 360Â°
images". In order to collect the test material, a rotating platform was designed and made.
The first part of the work includes a description of the depth estimation and image acquisition
methods. Next, the designed rotating platform has been described. The second part of
the work was devoted to the analysis of the results obtained. This part presents the method
of calibrating camera systems. The obtained internal and external parameters of the cameras
were presented. All received omnidirectional images obtained using the described methods
are presented. The last chapter contains a summary of the results obtained and conclusions.
